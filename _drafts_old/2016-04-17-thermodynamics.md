This article is a part of a series where I will be talking about thermodynamics. The [first part](http://psurya1994.github.io/thermodynamics-quantized-energy-levels) can be found here. I hope you enjoy reading this article as much as I did writing it.

###Non-ideal Gas Equations

The ideal gas equation `PV=nRT` works only at very low pressures. The gases are rarely ideal- this is because of the intermolecular forces. These forces are attractive at low temperature and pressure, and replusive at high temperature and pressure.

There are various models that predict this non-ideal behaviour inclulding Van Der Waals, Redlich-Kong and Peng-Robinson. The lattter two perform well in the liquid state where as Van's gives negative pressures.

**Food for thought:** *(It's likely I'm just thinking it wrong here, but making mistakes like these will only help me get better in my basics)*

The ideal gas equation, `PV=nRT`, is very interesting. Pressure, volume and temperature are quantities that we have defined; it surprising to see how they fit very well in a linear equation like that. Of course, this relation applies perfectly only at low pressure but, even it have something like that work is surprising. 

This is different from acceleration and velocity; which we have defined as derivate and double derivative of distance. Here, both pressure and volume are just different. How is it that they fit in perfectly for the equation?
