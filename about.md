My name is Surya. I'm presently doing my MSc Computer Science at McGill University and [Mila](http://mila.quebec/). I work on ideas at the intersection of reinforcement learning and neuroscience with [Blake Richards](http://linclab.org/). I'm interested in helping the research community collectively figure out the general principles behind intelligence. 

I've been collaborating with researchers at several institutes including RWTH Aachen, IISc Banglore, Defense Research Development Organisation and NIT Warangal.
