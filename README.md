To think:
- Tracking is essential if you want to make progress. What metric should I be using to track my life?
- What playing games like mafia exposes about me; and how I can change that
- External behaviour is a poor judge of consicousness. You could put a human inside a box, the external behaviour of the box tells you nothing about it's state of consciousness. The box doesn't do anything externally. 
- the discrepancy between discovery and learning. While learning helps, it also sets the priors strongly that it's hard to explore alternative hypothesis because you've made too many connections based on current understanding. 
- Argument for the use of systems in your life
- You play differently when someone's watching.
- Blog the discussion I had with Samaikya
- Blog: the case for using a smaller TV, smaller phone -> entertainment shouldn't be addictive. (i) higher risk of addiction, (ii) you'll be adjusted to it anyway, (iii) more features -> more sources of distraction. I'm trying to move to my iPad for most work, will let you know how it goes. 
- Blog: typical distractions in a work day-- attach photos. 
- think: is it possible to push somethign into long term memory without continual recall? is continual recall the key to long term learning?
- Blog: we're always chasing the next big thing
