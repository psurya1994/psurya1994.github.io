To take our work on **Building Mobile Game Solvers and Teach How** to the next level, we decided to raise money on the NITW Lakshya's crowdfunding platform.

You can see the campaign at this [link](http://www.thelakshyafoundation.org/crowdfunding/project/1).

The campaign was launched at *NITW Hackathon 5.0* and got an overwhelming response. 23% of the campaign was fulfilled within the first 10 minutes of launch, 100% in 24 hours and the stretch goal of 132% in 72 hours. 

This was the video that we used to raise the money.
