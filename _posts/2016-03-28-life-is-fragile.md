I don't remember the last time I had tears down my eyes but this film (Oopiri) has managed to do that. This is undoubtedly the best movie that I have watched in the recent past.

In this Telugu movie, which is based on a true story and is a remake of Intouchables, the main actor (Nagarjuna) is a billionare but wheel chair bound and has his whole body below the neck paralysed. He is a very successful business man, and becomes paralysed after a debacle when he goes for skydiving in Paris. In the movie, Nagarjuna says: 

>This is the place where I met with an accident five years ago. Within seconds, my whole life became a memory.

That's so scary. I think that there is a very important message that we have to take from this movie- **everything we have can be taken away from us in a matter of seconds.** And I think, this is something very important that we have to recognize and live with. A report estimates that, in India, there are 500,000 accidents in 2013 and 28.2% of them caused deaths. Almost no one of people who die here, them would have expected that this would happen to them. 

Life is fragile. We have to be mindful of what we are doing instead of just sailing through life. We have to recognize who lucky we are to have things that many people around the world are craving for. We have to be greatful for what we have. We have to thoughtful and take good decisions. 

This leads me to the point to think about be bigger questions? Am I playing my best game? Is this how I want my life to be? And the answer is no. There are many things that I should improve on. I want to recognize them by myself what many people recognize only after having a huge debacle in their life. I will not be lazy, I will be mindful, I will eat good food, I will mediate, and most importantly, I'll be happy for what I have.
