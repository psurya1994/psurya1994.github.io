It's interesting how matter exist only in three major stable states (let's consider this number for the sake of argument). Why is that? Why are there clear between boundaries between each of states? And why is it only 3 and not 10? It doesn't seem right. I don't think one could ever come up with these theories without observation.

Thermodynamics may give a reasonable explanation for this based on mathematical modelling of the interaction between the atoms, but is that convincing enough? New theories in thermodynamics, to my understanding, come up by coming up with an equation that fits the experimentally observed graph. 

Here are examples of the equations used in thermodynamics.

Is this ideally how we would want to understand the universe? Doesn't seem right. Is this the best way we have now? I think so. I think we should stick to this way of science based on observation until we find something better.

I posted the same in a Facebook post, and people commented their prespectives on this which helped me a lot to evolve my views. So let me try to answer that question for the previous me.

There are reasons why there are only three major states and science has figured that out. From solid state to liquid state, the transition happens suddenly when the kinetic energy of the molecules is high enough to overcome the lattice forces. For liquid to gas, it has to overcome the intermolecular forces. Further, for gas to plasma, it has to get over the atomic forces. 

You could ask- Ok, you're giving me the reasons why but it could be some other way; why does it work only like this? Well, that's how the world works, that's how the laws of nature. Why are the law of nature that way? We don't know yet. 

Coming to your understanding that equations in thermodynamics come out of thin air through trial and error is wrong. Each of the equations have been invented by different people and they have their names on it. Do you think they just keep trying out different equations randomly to see how it works? That's just not true.

The theory is much more involved than that. We solve the relevant quantum mechanic states and build up from there. You start with theory, derive the expressions. When the equations don't match experimental results, you change the theory and derive new equations. That's the difference between emphirical and theoritical laws. The approach you are talking about is taken by Kepler to derive the laws of planetary motion.

I'd agree that science can't be trusted if it were just about fitting graphs. But that's not how science works, and hence science is a lot more reliable than what you suggest it to be.

Thanks to **Samaikya Karri** for clarifying and helping me understand these concepts a lot better.
