I had a dream late at night which was pretty horrible. Something that made me feel very emotional. 

I had a dream that a couple of my cousins were playing with each other at the edge of the balcony. The elder one stood at the corner and said, "come over, I'll lift you." The younger one was very excited, and wanted to scare the elder by jumping on top of her with full speed. I was standing far away and I was just listening to this. I was shocked and before I could move, the younger one jumped on the elder, knocking her out of balance and she feel down from the balcony that was three floors high. That was horrific. I ran over to see that she was unconcious with her right hand cut off. I felt so bad, and responsible for what had happened. I was thinking of ways that I could have avoided that, and that's when I woke up.

That was a damn scary dream and an experience that I would never want to go through. The dream made me realize how careful we should be and how even the smallest precautions we don't take can completely turn our lives around. I went back to sleep.

 Next morning when I woke up, I had a missed call from my mom. I went to my university for a few days which is a few hours from home. I called her back and she told me that she had a severe chest pain last night at around 2 am asked me if there's a possibility I could  back home. Without hesitation, I packed my things and got into the train.

I'm writing this as I sit in the train thinking, are the two things that happened somehow related? Was the horrific dream suggesting that something bad was about to happen? 

I have not had dreams in the recent past and having a bad dream like this is improbable. The chance that my mom would have a heartpain like that unexpectedly is improbable. And both of them happening at around the same time- that's highly unlikely. This cannot be explained without the help of the supernatural. Right?

Wrong. I have to consider the number of times I had a bad dream from my childhood and nothing bad happened. From what I can recollect, I've had a lot of bad dreams and I don't think any of them were associated with bad events. I also have to consider the number of times someone close to me were feeling pain, and I had no dreams. This again looks like a significant number. 

Maybe I'd have had similar thoughts if I saw a black cat instead of having a dream, or having a glass break at home, or having a weird headache, or feeling little depressed, or some behavior of mine on the previous day. And bad event can be associated with someone close not feeling well, having a break up, having a close friend cheat you, or a thousand other things. There are millions of patterns that humans might find. When there are so many ways in which we can connect things, its not unlikely that one of them could happen by random chance and seems like that's what happened today.

Do you think it's fair to make conclusions about the supernatural with just one instance of something happened which very well may happen because of random chance? Of course not. There's no evidence for the supernatural here.

If we conduct a scientifically controlled experiment to start montoring from today to see the how many times I've a bad dream and something happening to people I love, the result will not end up more than a random chance.

These are generally the kinds of things that make people believe in the super natural and maybe there's some evolutionary reason behind why people believe that way. All of us, the humans, are just a bundle of cognitive biases. We see patterns where there are none. We see mountains in the shape of Elvis, we see faces of mars, and many more similar things.

Extraordinary claims like the super natural needs extraordinary evidence because they call for throwing the laws of physics that work every single day out of the window; and this is just not one of them.
