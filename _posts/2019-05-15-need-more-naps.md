When I'm relaxing to feel more energetic, I clearly see that taking a nap as I try to meditate on the bed makes me feel +10, while watching random videos or scrolling through social media gives me a -10. I should stop acting as if both are the same. I should clearly go for relaxing with mindfulness. While it still needs will power, I'm confident it's the best use of my will power. Hoping to do it more often!
