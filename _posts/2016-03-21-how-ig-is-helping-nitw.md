In this article, I talk about how the Innovation Garage is a great space for students to work, learn and collaborate.

In 2011, when I was in my first year, I was super enthusiastic to study and learn new things. I wanted a nice silent place where I could work seriously; and library seemed to be the best place. I started to spend more time in the library, but the fact that laptops were not allowed in there frustrated me. 

As my work got more and more associated with the internet, I could not work from the library anymore. What is the use of the library, I thought, if this generation that follows *eBooks more than normal books*, uses *google docs more than notebooks*  is not allowed to take their laptops?

I had no other option but to work from my room, and the environment was not very exciting. I always wanted a nice space where I could work and discuss ideas.

Three and half years later, the Innovation Garage was established on the campus just before I was about to graduate. A place that had been my dream, a place where you could work from, a place that was comfortable with AC, a place that had the facilities that allow to take you quick naps, and the most important of all- smartest people on campus working with you.

Even though I was feeling bad that this was not established earlier, I'm happy that my juniors on campus will be able to access my dream place.

When I visit NIT Warangal now, I start to realize that many students are not recognising this. Many students don't see how it can be used to collobrate with peers, and how it can change their life. Maybe it's just human nature that we take the things we have for granted. Or maybe I'm super lucky to have access to things like the high-speed internet that my seniors have and I have not recognized that. It's an interesting phenomena that humans don't recognize the important of things that have high accessablility.

Or maybe it's just me who is super enthusiastic about a place like this. Whatever be the case, this article is to trigger the readers (and me) to think about the how important many things around us are that we don't recognize.
