In this article, I talk about how the Innovation Garage is a great space for students to work, learn and collaborate; and how students maybe failing to recognize its importance.

In 2011, when I was in my first year, I was super enthusiastic to study and learn new things. I wanted a nice silent place where I could work seriously; and library seemed to be the best. I started to spend more time in the library, but the fact that laptops were not allowed in there frustrated me. 

As my work got more and more associated with the internet, I could not work from the library anymore. What is the use of the library, I thought, if this generation that follows *eBooks more than normal books*, uses *google docs more than notebooks*  is not allowed to take their laptops?

I had no other option but to work from my room, and the environment was not very exciting. I always wanted a nice space where I could work and discuss ideas.

Three and half years later, the Innovation Garage was established on the campus just before I was about to graduate. A place that had been my dream, a place where you could work from, a place that was comfortable (with AC), a place that has the equiment required for projects, a place that had the facilities that allow to take you quick naps, and the most important of all- it provides you an oppurtunity to work next to the smartest people on campus.

Even though I was feeling bad that this was not established earlier, I'm happy that my juniors on campus will be able to access my dream place.

When I visit NIT Warangal now, I start to realize that many students are not recognizing this. Many students don't see how it can be used to collobrate with peers, and how it can change their life. Maybe this is similar to how I failed to recognize things like the high-speed internet that my seniors did not have access to. It's an interesting phenomena that humans generally don't recognize the important of things.

Or maybe it's just me who is super enthusiastic about a place like this. Whatever be the case, this article is to trigger the readers (and me) to think about the how important many things around us are that we don't recognize.
