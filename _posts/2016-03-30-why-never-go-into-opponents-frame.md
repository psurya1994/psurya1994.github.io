This article is a short insight that shows you why getting into an opponents frame could be dangerous.

### What is framing?

Framing is the act of articulating your argument in words. The are many characterstics of a good frame such as- being sticky, being intuitively agreeable with, having villain, attack opponents core values, tap into societal undercurrents but we are not going to go through them in detail here.

### Problem with getting into opponents frame

You should never get into an opponents frame because it only gives them more air time and the viewers will be more likely to remember the frame than the arguments after a fair amount of time. For example, if someone accuses you saying, "**you are mad, how can you even imagine that this policy will be helpful**"; a bad response would be "**I am not mad. I can give you 10 reason why I'm not mad. I'm not mad because ...**" 

Even if you give a convincing answer, the opponent will strike back with another argument on why he thinks you're crazy; and the debate will revolve around the central point if you're crazy or not. You'll have the burden of proof to justify that you're not crazy. If you don't prove is clearly, you're in a huge mess with most people thinking that you may or may not be crazy; and they don't want to take a chance, so they won't support you.

The ideal way to respond instead is to come up with a new frame of your own, following the characterstics of a good frame.

### Example 1

Presidential elections were held in America in 1988. The Democratic candidate was Michael Dukakis. He is an outspoken opponent of the death penalty. At the time, many Americans were in favour of the death penalty. His wife was Kitty Dukakis.

You will see a short video of a debate in the middle of the campaign between Dukakis and his republican opponent George Bush sr. Michael Dukakis was asked a very straightforward question: if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would he then be in favour of the death penalty for the perpetrator?

</div>

Even though that's not the best response, Michael Dukakis doged a bullet not getting into the opponents frame. He responds to the allegation and comes out of the frame making his larger point. If he did go into the frame, his response would be something in the lines of, "**No, even if my wife Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, I would still not being favor of death penality. The reason is because...**" 

Even though that might be a sensible thing to say, in the context of the debate he would sound like a lunatic with no empathy. 

### Example 2

Here's an instance where Richard Nixon, president of the USA denies his involvement in the Watergate scandal on November 17th 1973 by getting into the opponents frame and saying, "**I am not a crook**" Recognize why this is a bad way to respond as you watch the video.
