I don't proofread most of the articles I write. I just write thoughts on my head quickly and put them out there. I don't even proofread. So if something's not clear on my blogs, it's on me. 

But this is a good thing. If I were looking for more accuracy and clarity on these artciles, I might need to spend a lot more time. Time that I could use on other important projects. I wouldn't be able to put up lots of thoughts at this pace at all if I were spending more time on each. 

And I don't believe these all blog posts will be helpful for most people. I just write various things I want to say without thinking if people wanna hear it or not. So I might end up talking about something that's boring to you quite often. I perfectly understand if you wanna stop following me.
