Naveen asked me to write [for him](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbSu5K4tDEaMAnJFL35qwUgh_uw8S2HZQhH7ekJiDrM/). Reposting my response here. Below is his note to me. 

`Surya, I understand you like the work of Cal Newport on Deep Work which you have been for quite some time. I was wondering if you can share your experience with us which I think can be quite beneficial for anyone reading it. To start off, I've listed three simple questions, you can add more details if you'd like to.`**

My response to it is below.

**In short, how do you define Deep Work?**
* Planned 0-distraction pomodoro sessions on a single task. Many tricks on how to do it effectively are shared in the book which are quite helpful. (ex. making grand gestures, having a shutdown routine, tracking progress during session, maintaining a scorecard, pomodoros, etc.)

**What are the preparations you do before hand for this?**
* I plan (but not as much as I should yet). I minimize distractions-- turn off internet block software, keep water next to me, eat sometime if I'm hungry, turn off my phone. If I'm feeling lazy/tired, I follow Spencer Greenberg's Cool Reboot strategy to feel more active. 

**Can you please your experience so far and how helpful it has been? (If you can add one or two specific experiences that'd be great)**
* It's been a wonderful experience, I'm happy that I'm experimenting with these ideas. I have good and bad sessions. In good sessions, I go into the experience of flow (which is the most pleasurable experience in life). In bad sessions, I kinda push myself to make it through. Still figuring out and experimenting to understand what leads to good and bad sessions. 
* Somedays, due to external factors, a complete 0-distraction is not possible. It's okay, just try to minimize them as much as you can and keep going. Doesn't always have to be deep work.
