This is a follow up of the article [What's the Goal of Life? (Part 1)](http://psurya1994.github.io/goal-of-life) I think many of my views in there are not ideally the person that I want to be. I'm a lot better than that.

Am I being content? I guess I am. Are there things I've to change? Absolutely. Am I changing them? No. Why? I'm just too caught up in what I'm trying to complete the tasks I have now. Am I completing the tasks as quickly as possible? No, I'm doing them slowly at my own pace. After knowing all these facts about myself. The fact that I'm not playing my best game. The fact that I'm not working hard enough. The fact that I'm not doing what I'm fully capable of. Does this make me happy? Is this the person I want to be for the rest of my life? Absolutely not.

In the previous article, I told that I'm happy. But that happiness seems to be an illusion. I would certainly not be happy if I continue doing this for the rest of my life. I need to grow. Growing is what I've to derive my happiness from. Being a smarter person and work at the edge of my limits is what will give me real happiness.

It doesn't matter much what I'm doing, what only matters is how hard I'll work. I just have to work hard, very hard, extremely hard. I have to give my 100% to anything that I work on from now.

I'm so lucky to have this opportunity to not work in a formal job. I think I have a responsibilty to use this opportunity well. To burn myself out and keep learning in the process. The happiness through working hard far outwwight the happiness though slow work without pressure.

So I decide not to be content with the person I am now, and keep growing each day. I should be able to answer the question what did you learn each week.
