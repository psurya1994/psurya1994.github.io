title: Contributor for Stanford's First Crowd Course
---

I'm happy that I got an oppurtunity to be a contributor for the first online course that has been created through the [Stanford's Crowd Course Initiative](http://crowdcourse.stanford.edu/index.html). It is an experimental program by Stanford researchers to explore the possibility of collaborative teaching or course creation.

You can have a look at the course at this [link](crowdcourse.stanford.edu/courses.html).

> Videos by: Josh Pitkofsky and Surya Penmetsa

> Team: Ian Bantoto, Avik Basu, Khushali Desai, Narendra Nath Joshi, Jay Lim, Manoj Pandey (admin), Surya Penmetsa, Josh Pitkofsky, Min J. Roh, Feiyu Tao, Bhavin Thaker - from Canada, India, Singapore and USA.

### My Contributions

I was a part of the team that made the first course **Introduction to Python** (which had 7 modules) on this platform. I made the slides for the first module `Module 1: Getting Started`. I also gave the voice over and edited the videos for `Module 2: Data Types`, `Module 3: Loops`, `Module 4: Functions` and `Module 6: Classes`.

### What I Learned

Being one of a team of eleven from around the world to create Stanford University's first crowd sourced online course, I had a great experience. We used Slack as the communication platform. All the members of the were very polite, and provided contructive feedback. Here's how we collaborated to create the course-

* Decided on the syllabus for the couse.
* Split the topics and created presentation for each fo them.
* Added notes to the presentation- they contain exactly how we would talk while taking the course.
* Josh and Me created the videos for the modules.

It's nice to see how we can collaborate with people around the world to build something cool in very less time. (we took just 5 days) I hope this experience helps me do better in the projects that I take up in future.
