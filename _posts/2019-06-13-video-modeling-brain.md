Here's a recording of the talk that I gave at MILA (cognitive AI reading group). I hope you find it helpful. It didn't come out as well as I'd like, but don't wanna rerecord (did these runs too many times, it's kinda boring now :P).

You can find the [slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nD_AHxUT0OXQd_EIxy5I9rnmwdFiqjx96p5_LMOJkrE).
