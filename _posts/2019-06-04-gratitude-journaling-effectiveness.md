I've heard a lot about the effectiveness of gratitude journaling and I've incorporated variations of it into my morning routines for extended periods of time. It seems to me that it is not as affective as many people suggest.

My hypothesis on why it did not work is that it is become I was already quite satisfied with life (and maybe I'm already quite grateful for the things around me, atleast more than the ones who were studied in the gratitude journaling research). It might be more effective on people who are more depressed and anxious than I am.
