I have been battling with procrastination for far too long right now. I am getting incrementally better, but that just isn't enough. I have to end this once and for all. This blog is a reminder for that and a way to get it done; to end this battle. 

It's crappy to keep fighting the same battle over the over again. Not wanting to get out of bed in the morning. Not wanting to go to the gym. Not wanting to clean my room. Not wanting to study. Even if I do well for a month minimizing procrastination, the moment I take it lightly it just come back rushing quite soon. For example, I did Project Focus (add hyper link) for a month and I was feeling quite good about it. A few days back I realized that I'm spending too much time on unproductive internet activities again. Doing Project Focus for a month is just not enough. I need to actively and carefully continue working on ideas like those for a much longer period of time. 

Here's what I'm going to do to fix procrastination: 
- Procrastination because I'm tired-- do Spencer's Cool Reboot. Sometimes, a nap is all you need. 
- Procrastination because I'm addicted (to say a TV series)-- this is the hardest thing to. I need to be very aware and take all actions to keep myself out of this state. This is the worst, and is in complete opposition to all the things that I value for myself. 
	- Make sure I'm hydrated and and not hungry
	- Get that food and continue watching as I eat
	- Switch to table and chair (instead of bed)
	- After some more time, use all your will power to go out for a run. Follow it up with bath. 
- Procrastination because I don't feel motivated enough-- 
	- Think about Jocko Willink and Gary Vee.
	- Think about that one person who's working very hard at this very moment. You'll come across him one day and fight for something that you value most. You need to be prepared.
	- Think about people who you know, who're younger than you but still accomplishing just as much or event much more
	- Just pick up an online course you like and start learning to get the momentum.
	- Jot down your intenstions clearly and think about the importance of having actions and intensions inline.
	- Make a commitment to a friend and schedule a call. 
- When you feel frustrated after learning a concept for a while. It just means that you need to take a break. You'll feel better for sure once you come back after a break, I promise.
