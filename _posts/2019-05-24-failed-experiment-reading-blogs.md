I decided with a friend that we would reading interesting blogs from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/), [GoogleAI](https://ai.googleblog.com) and more. Tracking was done on [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BpBD0RWI7KOI60ON0HlTusS5A7E-EV5BVeSXSZQNl5E/).
 
We reasoned that reading these blogs with help us get a good overivew of the state-of-the-art research happening in these labs. And gamefying it by tracking what we read and our summaries/views on the research in the same sheet, I thought would be quite motivating.

The project is now dumped (on May 21st) due to lack of progress. Here are some reason for failure, jotting them down as they will help me plan better in future. 
* My routines weren't in place and I had not much control over my environment. I wasn't in that zone of working hard and competing during that period of time. 
	* Note to future me: Start such projects only when you're very excited in the beginning confident enough that you'll follow through.

I do realize this is so much better than not trying at all. I'm proud of this failure and committed to fixing it in future.
