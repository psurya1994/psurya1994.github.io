[Hello internet](http://hellointernet.fm) is a podcast by CGP Grey and Brady Haran, two YouTuber who are so similar, and yet so different. In this article, I'd like to talk about how the podcast helped me personally. 

Grey is someone who's more kind of a organized guy who perfectly plans his day; and works with no deviations. He is very thoughtful about what he wants to spend his energy on and takes decisions carefully. On the other hand, Brady is someone who is more fun loving, not-very-organised. Of course, he's very sucessful and manages a lot of projects; but he plans less.

Their conversations on various topics are wonderful. Grey comes out with thoughtful opinions on topics, and Brady does an amazing job as the devils advocate. Brady can argue for any side very strongly. He makes some wonderful counter arguments, and it's interesting how Grey strikes back countering his claims.

This podcast has taught me a lot of things. I learnt a lot on how to be very thoughtful. I learn how to be the devils advocate and make people think more about their own position in an argument. It made me so much better in having conversations, I'm so glad I started listening to this. I'd rate this as one of the most important things in the last 3 years that changed my life for the better.
