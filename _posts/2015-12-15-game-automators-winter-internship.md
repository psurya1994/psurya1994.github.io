I organised the a winter internship at Innovation Garage, NIT Warangal to get students to work on solving new games. This was the rise of the [Game Automators](http://gameautomators.com).

I'm attaching two videos that sum up what happened.

### Video 1: Call for interns

This is the video calling for students to apply for the internship program. It got good response, and I selected 14 people out of all who applied to work with me during winter.
