How should we tackle claims based on no evidence? Should we be 50-50 (it's 50% percent likely that the claim is true), or should we be 0-100 (it's 0% likely that the claim is true), or somewhere in between? In this article, I argue that claims that are made based on no evidence are very unlikely to be true and must be given no credence.

Once could argue saying: *Before people started looking for evidence that the earth was sperical, almost everyone thought that it was flat. If someone would have proposed the idea that earth was sperical then, it would have been bizarre. No one would have accepted it. But as evidence came along, things changed. Hence, you cannot say that science is a way to understand the reality. Science is a field that is rapidly changing with new theories coming up each day. Science can be wrong. Hence, disagreeing with something because the present day science can't figure that out is insane. You must have an open mind to other possibilities instead of being narrow minded.*

Well, that's could sound like a convincing argument but there are huge flaws in there. 

Let's go centuries back when people thought earth was flat. If someone proposes that earth is sperical **based on no evidence**, I would still say he should not be given anymore credence. We should ask how does he know it? If he has evidence, only then can his claim be taken seriously. If he says he just feels it, or that a deity appeared in him dream and revealed this to him, that's no evidence.

Without evidence, one can propose anything- that earth is in a star shape, earth is in a triangle shape, earth is in a diamond shape, or that earth is the size of a dust particle on the hair of a massive alien. Do all these million random claims have to be given credence? Of course not.

> Science is the best way to understand the reality of the universe.

I agree there's a possibility that everything science has figured out is wrong, but that's unlikely. Science is being used today and it works. Evolution, earth is sperical, universe started with the big bang, and other claims have overwhelming scientific evidence which makes it very unlikely for them to be wrong.

Arguing that science hasn't figure something out yet, so this possible theory could be true is unreasonable. 

Recently, I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C1p4HUHlfE) where Sadhguru made a claim that water can change it's molecular structure based on human thoughts. That's a insane claim, it goes about almost everything we know, it breaks almost every law of physics. There's no way; he must be given no credence at all. 

As scientists, we need to be skeptics. We should not assume anything is correct by default. The burden of proof lies on the person who makes such a claim to come up with very strong evidence. Poorly conducted research shouldn't be given any more credence here either.

> If someone make a random claim like that, arguing saying show me a scientific experiment that proves otherwise is insane! 

For instance, let me take the example quoted by Richard Dawkins in his book The God Delusion. What if someone claims that, "there is a tea pot that is in space between earth and mars, and praying to that can give us energy? The present day telescopes are not good enough to observe the tea pot because that's too small." You certainly can't prove him wrong, does it mean you have to give him more credence? Absolutely not.

If there's a claim based on no evidence, but that's the only plausible explanation- it's a different scenario. This is one argument people make for god; I don't agree with that but this is a seperate topic that I will go into in another blog.

Science works everyday and is far more reliable than anything else.
