This is an article with valuable learning strategies which I can help you score well on any exams. Some of the strategies are much broader than exams. These are the strategies I used to go from 313 to 330 on my GRE. 

Some background: After I scored 330 (Verbal: 160, Quant: 170) on my GRE, many people reached out to me asking me how I prepared for the exam. I thought it'd be more helpful if I can address all the questions openly so that anyone can read. Before this attempt, I took GRE in 2014 when I scored 313 (Verbal: 149, Quant: 165) even though I worked hard. I did things differently this time. I think, having been on both the sides, keeps me in a slightly better position to judge which way of studying is effective and which is not.

I organized a Q&A session on Facebook covering all these strategies, here's the link: [https://www.facebook.com/psurya1994/posts/10210585087013029](https://www.facebook.com/psurya1994/posts/10210585087013029)
