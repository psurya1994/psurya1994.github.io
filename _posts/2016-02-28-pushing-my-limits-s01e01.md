This is a new experimental video series that I am starting called **Pushing My Limits** where I put myself in difficult situations and see how I respond to that. This is the first episode **The Interview** where I pushed myself to be on the receiving end of an interview. Without further ado, I present you the video.

Please let me know what you think. Depending on the response, I will decide if I have to continue doing the series.
