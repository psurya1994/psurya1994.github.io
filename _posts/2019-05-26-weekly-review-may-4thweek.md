This is an introspection of how my last week went. Wasn't as introspective as I'd want it to be. Here's the agenda:
* General introspection:
	* 3 good things about last week
	* 3 things that need improvement from last week
* The Big Picture:
	* Goals completed last week
	* Goals for this week
* Changes I will make:
	* Intrinsic changes (internal dialouge, the story I tell myself, cognitive tricks to avoid procrastination, etc.)
	* Extrinsic changes (environmental, public/personal commitments, behavioral, external accountability etc.)

## General introspection

3 good things:
* Amazing consistency is the morning routine and deep work sessions. Never been this consistent.
* Waking up on time
* Working out everyday

3 things that can be improved:
* Focus on the hard things first
* Track things completed daily more closely
* Keep it to one task in a session, no switching. Better planning before sessions too.
 
## The big picture

Goals finished last week:
* Good progress on CompNS course
* Good progress on reading papers

Goals this week:
* Complete computational theory course (8 hours)
* Do CompNS course: understand three weeks deeply (15 hours)
* Do eight good programming problems (4 hours)
* Implement a neural network from scratch (10 hours)

## Changes I will make

Intrinsic:
* Use the 5-second rule to be more productive

Extrinsic:
* Continuing to say no more often and protecting my momentum.
