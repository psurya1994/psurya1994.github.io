Being polite to others is extremely important; be it anyone: friends, parents or even your worst enemy. 

### Why Be Polite?

I came across a situation today where two of my good friends had a disagreement on something that was very important and personal to the both of them. I'm sorry that I can't reveal the specifics here. My friend 1 request friend 2 to do something, and he think is unfair. He responded in a rude manner. From his prespective, I do understand why he thinks it's unfair and way he was rude. From the friend 1's prespective, I see that it's wrong to be so rude.

Why role did being rude serve here? **Absolutely nothing**

Looking at it as a third person, what I see here is two people getting angry and stressed- the main reason; one of them was not polite. What if, both of them were just as polite as have a honest conversation about it instead of the rude and sarcastic replies? I think, it would have been a much more productive conversation and they might have atleast agreed on their disagreements.

So, from now, even if I disagree with people on specifics, I will try to have as honest a conversation as possible which is a win-win for both. Looking at free will, I think, is one important concept that could help us look at things that way.

### Free Will

This brilliant [thought experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5ebjk319Wg) from Sam Harris demonstrates that free will is an illusion.

Let us do a similar experiment now. Take your own time to do it.

<div class="message">
  Think of a movie, and as you do, try to pay attention to see what this conscious process is like.
</div>

##### Part 1

* There are many movies whose names are known to you, but just did not occur in your mind. **Were you free to choose that did not occur you to choose?**
* Let's take the movie **Gone Girl**. You know this movie, but you just did not choose it- the reason: there were many movies popping up due to some unconscious processes in your brain and **Gone Girl** was just not one of them. Did you have conscious control over the movies that were coming in? No! So, were you free to choose **Gone Girl**? No! You were just a receiver of the movies that were popping up from somewhere.

##### Part 2

* People can now argue saying, "Well, but I was free to choose one from the movies that popped up, I have free will." Here's why that's wrong.
* Look closely. Do you know why you picked what you picked? You might have some story to tell about it; but many psychology experimentshow that these stories are almost always wrong. It's something else that has driven you to take the decision. 
* Even if your story was correct, you can't explain why that specific story was processed in your brain but not something else. It's a result of an unconscious process that you have no control over.

Hence, free will is an illusion! We don't know what we are going to think or feel next.

### How To Perceive People?

Now, if applying this concept to people. Here's how we should look at them: *People are a result of the way the neurons are connected in the brain. These connections depend upon- past experiences, randomness, genetics, etc., They are just organic molecules in an organised pattern.* 

We punish murderers because all of us are better off that way. This helps look at people differently. We are pushnishing them because the rest of us are better off that way; not because they deserve the punishment.

Similary, we have to be polite to everyone because they are just like anyone of us- organiz molecules connected in a specific pattern.
