What is the goal of my life? This is a question that keeps many of us pondering. It very rarely leads to a clear answer, but let's try to tackle to question.

What does one actually want to achieve in life? What's the goal of life? It could be one of the following.

* Is it making more money? 
* Is it being more happy? 
* Is it getting a good job? 
* Is it being the smartest person in the world? 
* Is it helping as many people as possible? 
* Is it having a perfect personal life? 
* Is it changing the world?

In India, or at least the environment that I have grown in, people tend to see that getting a good job and earning a lot as the ultimate goal. They say with job (or money), everything else falls in place. It's simply not true. How do they know what makes us happy? I know many people who are doing a high paid job, but are not happy. If there's one thing I know for certain, it's that a rigid 9-5 job doesn't make me happy.

According to me, being happy and satisfied is the goal of life. 

People can argue that sitting in the room and eating icecream till the end of my life can give me satisfaction. They could argue that taking addictive drugs gives them satisfaction. But these are just instant gratifications. You feel good and then you don't. You feel good and then you don't. This isn't what I define as satisfaction but rather you've to do things that keep you satisfied in the long term irrespective of anything else. 

### Personal Decisions

For me, I want to do things that make me happy, and keep me satisfied. I'm presently taking a break from my formal education. I'm enjoying the freedom I have now. I'm working on a ways to make learning fun, freelance projects and taking a lot of online courses. I enjoy what I do and I'm fully satisfied. I'm earning enough money to live with all basic needs fulfilled and having some more money to spend.

People argue with me that going ahead and doing my masters will be helpful for getting a job, earning money, being on the safe side, learning new things, and meeting awesome new people. I personally don't yet feel the need to do a masters degree. I think doing a masters degree would be more risky than continuing what I'm going because the fees are high, and I'll have a do a high-earning job to clear it off. It might force me into a different path that the one I intend to follow. I do agree there's a high chance that I'll meet super awesome people and learn a lot. But that comes with a tradeoff that I really don't want to take. Atleast at this point of time in my life.
