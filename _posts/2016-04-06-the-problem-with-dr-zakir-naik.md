Religion and studying it's impacts is something that interests me. In this article, I'd like to talk about Dr. Zakir Naik who seems to be misleading millions with incorrect and dishonest arguments.

I wanted to read the Quran to learn something that'll be valuble; but I was surprised to see what's in there. Some of the verses seemed to be mocking the unbelievers and I thought this is a bad place for anyone to get their moral values from.

I started having conversations with Muslim friends asking them how these verses could be justified. Some of them (I would not like to take names here) gave me arguments that I was not convinced with, and they guided me towards the videos of Dr. Zakir Naik. They told me I should watch his videos to learn more about what Islam actually is.

Dr. Zakir Naik is an Islamic preacher and apparently, he is a trained medical doctor. I had a very open mind and would have converted to Islam is he'd have been convincing enough. Not surprisingly, his arguments made no sense.

I though he was a nice person who was inspiring people to do good things but after watching this video I've lost all trust on him.

He actually thinks evolution is not real and that's not the worst part. He actually has the audacity to say, "**most of the scientists today do not agree with Darwin's theory**". It's evident from his talk that he hasn't looked at the evidence for evolution. He thinks evolution is based only on fossil record. He doesn't even know as much as I do about evolution.

> Almost every scientist would unequivocally say that evolution is a fact.

Evolution has been verified by multiple independent branches of science- DNA, palentology, anatomy, geographical distribution, experiments in lab, etc., He's a fucking medical doctor; how in the world can he say something as ridiculous, I will never know.

> By this point, it must be clear to you that Dr. Zakir Naik either knows absolutely nothing about science or is a dishonest man deluding millions of people. Either way, he deserves no followers.

Further, in the above video, Dr Zakir Naik claims that 80% of the Quran is in line with science; where as 20% is ambiguious. He is factually wrong. There are many claims in the Quran which are clearly rejected by Science.  [http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Quran](Ref) 

Dr Zakir Naik also says, "little knowledge of science makes you atheist, indepth knowledge of science makes you believe in god."

Again, if you look at the data; he's wrong. According to a survey- 90% of people believe in god, 60% of scientists believe in god, 10% of elite scientists believe in god [1].  Clearly, with increasing knowledge of science; lesser people believe in god. I know he's great at articulation and has a read most of the religious literature, but I don't think I can trust him more because I see him make a lot of factually incorrect claims.

> Making up things in the name of science to spread his religion is horrible and Dr. Zakir Naik manages to do just that.

Most people don't know that and they go by Dr Naik because they trust him. Deluding people who trust you is one of the worse things I can imagine. I hope people realize that this guy has no idea what he's talking about whenever he takes the name of science and stay away from all his bullshit.
