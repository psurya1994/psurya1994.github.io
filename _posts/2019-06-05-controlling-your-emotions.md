These are my quick thoughts, I'm sure there are better resources on the internet that would be more helpful.

There are two aspects to this: 
* Your body biologically responds to the event (with chemicals in your brain) making you feel angry, frustrated, sad, higher heart rate, etc.
* How you physically react in response to these changes in your body.

Fixes:
* You don't have immediate control over (i), it can be fixed in the long term with things like meditation. 
* You do have control over (ii). It can be controlled by:  (a) recognizing these changes in your body when they happen, (b) using self-control to not do something you'll regret.
