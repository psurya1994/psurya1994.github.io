Here is my present routine that is working very well. Willing to stick with the same template for longer to lead a happy and productive time.

- Wake up between 4.30 and 5.00am
- Do 2.5 hours of deep work and morning routine
- Watch an episode on Netflix
- Sleep for an hour or two
- Wake up at 10am, try to get in a few more hours of deep work
- 1pm, eat and do deep work or an hour in the gym
- 5pm and later, no work; try new fun things. (ex. running at new places, trying kick boxing class, going to social events, work on a creative fun project, etc.)
