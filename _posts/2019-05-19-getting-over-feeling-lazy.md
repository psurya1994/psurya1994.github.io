We often feel tired and lazy, it's not a good state of mind to be in. Here, I talk about a few things you can do to feel better.

Things you need to check/do when you're feeling lazy or tired.
* Did you get enough sleep? Are you feeling tired? Try Spencer's Cool Reboot.
* Are you depressed/anxious? Try things that evidence shows is effective for depression. Ex. sports, hanging out with friends, taking a self-defense class, etc.
* Did you drink enough water? Drink water.
* Did you eat good food? Plan so that this doesn't repeat again
* Did you exercise today? Even a quick walk is much better than doing nothing.
* Have you been doing the same thing for long? Then take a break, maybe walk outside.

This is much better explained on Spencer's blog posts, and they're much more insightful than mine. Links: [cool reboot](https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg/posts/10103545206479592), [motivation on projects](https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg/posts/10103723349928692)
