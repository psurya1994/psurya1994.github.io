For any routine and habits you wanna build, momentum is the key. Momentum is what keeps you going, it's sets your default (determines what you'll do in autopilot). Give it the value and respect it deserves. Momentum makes it much easier to do whatever you wanna do. This is a note to myself on the decisions I shouldn't take when I have momentum.

I started this month very strong and am able to stick to plans and schedules more easily than ever. It's because of the momentum I've built over the last 20 days. Now that I have this momentum, I do not take it lightly at all. I'm gonna give it all the respect it deserves. 

I can remember times in the past when I build momentum, the reason the routine broke is because I take it lightly sometimes. Some of my internal thoughts: "I've worked very hard for so much time, let me watch some Netflix to relax" or "let me watch YouTube" etc. Doing that breaks momentum like no other. I cannot take any such decisions unless I'm sure I need such a break. I need to be vary of my decisions so that I don't lose my momentum.
