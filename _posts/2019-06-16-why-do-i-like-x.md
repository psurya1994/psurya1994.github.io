When I have conversations with people, they often ask the "why" questions. Why are you interested in machine learning? Why do you like working out?

I find these "why" questions often hard to answer. Why do we like anything, right. I don't think it's something that's entirely under your control. I don't think the story that most people may come up with would be accurate. I don't think you choose what you like, it just happens. A simple copout to many of these questions would be, because it feels good. Which begs the question, why does it? If doing ML feels good, don't other subjects feel good too? 

Now that I'm writing, maybe there is a decent way to answer "why are you interested in ML?" ML falls in the right intersection of what I like doing and what I'm good at. Maybe that's what I'll use from now on. I'm still uncomfortable with other kinds of why questions though.
