FOSSASIA 2016 was a great time for Game Automators, we could successfully present the work we've been doing with Game Automators and have discussions with other members from the open source design and development communities about the work, the impact that it could deliver. The fun filled talk grabbed the attention of everyone in the lab at Science Center of Singapore and drew attention from designers, developers, academicians and hackers alike.

People loved what we're doing out here with Game Automators. There's a lot more that's left to achieve and FOSSASIA has definitely been a step towards reaching our goals and reaching to the community with the amazing work we're doing.
