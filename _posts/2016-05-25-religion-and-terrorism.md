Religion has nothing to do with terrorism: Are You Kidding Me? There are people who claim that religion has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism which is plainly false. I intend to make a case for that in this article.

We could argue about the degree of impact religion is having on terrorism, but people who say terrorism has nothing to do with religion have either not thought about the problem deeply enough or have thought about it very badly. 

Further, a friend of mine (who is very smart, and makes complete sense on many issues) claims that all terrorists are atheists- I'm not sure if you could find something more false than this sentence. Atheists are people who don't believe in God, terrorists believe- they are just opposites, I can't conceive of a way in which you could interpret that terrorists are atheists. I hope I can have a conversation with him soon, and try to understand as best as I can what he is to offer.

Most studies show that there's no correlation between education or economic levels and the likelihood of them becoming terrorists.

Why is it that only Muslims turn into terrorists if Islam has nothing to do with terrorism? It's because (a plausible interpretation of) the Quran urges people to do so.

Issam Abuanza, 37, a NHS doctor left his promising career, wife and two kids to serve the islamic state[1]. And there are many stories like this; how can one explain this if not for religion? If not for religion, what would urge him to help the other Islamic state fighters? He does that because a plausible interpretation of the Quran says so.
