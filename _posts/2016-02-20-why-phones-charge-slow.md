Have you ever wondered why your phones charges slowly when connected to a different adaptor, laptop or when you use different USB cable? This video explains why.

### Transcript

USB is a popular interface used to connect your computer to electronic devices such as your phone.

Laptop’s USB ports are of two types - USB 2.0 and USB 3.0. 

In USB 3.0, when any device is connected to a USB port, the port only supplies one unit of current, i.e. 150 mA initially (each unit is 100 mA in USB 2.0). And then it increases in steps only after a digital negotiation. This can go only upto 0.9A maximum. This is the reason laptops charge your devices very slowly.

However, when you are not synchronising any data, it is possible to take more power from the laptop by disabling data sync. In fact, USB 3.0 ports on laptops can supply upto 1.5 A as long as there is no data sync.

#### How is it done?

When a phone/tablet is connected to a power source, it tries to read what type of power source it is. They are mainly three types-
Standard Downstream Port which is meant for data sync
Charging Downstream Port which is meant for Data sync and charging
Dedicated Charging Port (DCP) which is meant for only charging

For the phone to charge at maximum power, it has to see a  Dedicated Charging Port (DCP).

Different devices have their customised protocols to recognize DCP. Here are a few-
Battery Charging 1.0, 1.1, 1.2
YD/T-1591 spec 
Samsung Fast charging standard
Apple iPhone Fast charging standard
Apple iPad Fast charging standard etc.

The mobile device can recognize a DCP by reading the voltage on data lines. Normal wall chargers tie the data lines at the required voltage levels as per the standard demanded by the phone. 

Also, one reason why some phones charge slowly when connected to another phone’s adaptor is because they maybe using a different DCP standard. However, this is not the only reason- it could also be because the cable or the adaptor don’t support that much current.

#### Muconnect

Here is one gadget that can solve the slow charging problem on the laptop - [MuConnect](http://muconnect.co)

MuConnect when set to fast charging mode, auto detects which type of standard the connected device follows, disconnects the data lines between laptop and phone and ties the data lines at the phone end at the required voltage, thus signalling the device to take more current.  This helps charge your devices fast even from a laptop.
