Have you ever been more motivated in the past but not as motivated right now. Here are a few suggestions/thoughts that might help.

Few thoughts I have:
1. Seems like a problem of narrative to me too. What narrative did you have when believe you had the spark? What kind of behaviours did that lead you to take? Try to behave the same as before and you'll start feeling the spark.
2. This is a good [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3VWbWk8qDBiF0741izgpQg) who keeps talking about productivity, his knowledge is complication of lots and lots of books. I've been adopting his strategies and changing it to fit me. That's where I got the idea of pomodoro for 2 minutes. Maybe watch a few of his videos, has interesting videos on how to get work done consistently. 
3. Do not wait for the narrative to convince you before acting. Just act on the things you believe will push you forward and the narrative will fall in place by itself. 
4. How often do you meet friends? Just hanging out and having fun? Maybe you should do it more often? Have a part of your week just dedicated to fun without thinking about anything work or career related. 
5. Do gratitude journaling consistently?
6. What's your ideal destination? Spend 30 minutes on the question and come up with an answer. Slowly convert more and more behaviors direction towards your destination.
