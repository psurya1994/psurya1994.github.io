I wanted to figure out the best activities/entertainment one can take up during study/work breaks. I posted the same on Facebook and got some interesting answers. 

Here's a list of all things (mine + suggestions from others) which might help you. See what makes the most sense to you and try it out. :)
* A quick run outside (or other kind of cardio/strength activity)
* Reading books
* Listening to podcasts
* Binge watching course trailers on edX/Coursera
* Taking a nap
* Cooking
* Talking to friends/family
* Meditation
* Listening to music
* Drawing/Painting
* Sitting in nature and doing nothing
* Making coffee or cooking something
* Origami
* Juggling balls
* Rubik's cube
* Chess tactics (this something gets counter productive, I get attached to it and want to continously keep doing them)
* Solving puzzle questions
* Solving programming questions
* Introspection

Things that are counter productive:
* Watching a series on Netflix
* Watching your favourite sports game
* Browsing social media
* Watching random videos on YouTube
* Playing video games
* Reading Quora (gives you an illusion of learning new things, an illusion of productivity and you won't often remember any of these for long; it could be addicting to read answers continously. I realize this could be very helpful for others, it's just not my thing.)

Here's [my Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/psurya1994/posts/10219251492907760) on the topic. All of the examples are broad generalizations. I'm not saying the examples above must apply for everyone (or even most people). They're activities that I personally find helpful.
