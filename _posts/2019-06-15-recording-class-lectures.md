This is my argument of why it's important to have video lectures recorded for any advanced course.

Different people study at different speeds. Some student might want to spend more time thinking and understand a specific concept covered. All of this is just impossible without recording the lectures. This is clearly not possible to do real time in the class. You need to have an option of pausing the class and thinking through, to stay inline with what the teacher's saying specially when it's an advanced course.

I know that some may argue that students will stop coming to the class if we post the lecture online. If that is the case, that there are too less students that the prof is unable to teach effectively, maybe that's acceptable. But I don't think that's the case very often.

Other may argue it's additional effort and they don't see much upsides of doing it. Which might be a fair point, I know it's going to help me, but is it going to help most others? The burden is on the students to convey that they find the recordings helpful.

I also think it's quite important to be very specific about the topics that are going to be covered in the next class. Helps me prepare much better for the classes, which make them much more enjoyable.
