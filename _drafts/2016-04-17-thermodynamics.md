This article is a part of a series where I will be talking about thermodynamics. The [first part](http://psurya1994.github.io/thermodynamics-quantized-energy-levels) can be found here. I hope you enjoy reading this article as much as I did understanding it.

The ideal gas equation, `PV=nRT`, is very interesting. Pressure, volume and temperature are quantities that we have defined; it surprising to see how they fit very well in a linear equation like that. Of course, this relation applies perfectly only at low pressure but, even it have something like that work is surprising.
