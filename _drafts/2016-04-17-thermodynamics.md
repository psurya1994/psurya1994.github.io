This article is a part of a series where I will be talking about thermodynamics. The [first part](http://psurya1994.github.io/thermodynamics-quantized-energy-levels) can be found here. I hope you enjoy reading this article as much as I did understanding it.

It's interesting how matter exist only in three major stable states (let's consider this number for the sake of argument). Why is that? Why are there clear between boundaries between each of states? And why is it only 3 and not 10? It doesn't seem right. I don't think one could ever come up with these theories without observation.

Thermodynamics may give a reasonable explanation for this based on mathematical modelling of the interaction between the atoms, but is that convincing enough? New theories in thermodynamics, to my understanding, come up by coming up with an equation that fits the experimentally observed graph. 

Is this ideally how we would want to understand the universe? Doesn't seem right. Is this the best way we have now? I think so. I think we should stick to this way of science based on observation until we find something better.

The ideal gas equation, `PV=nRT`, works only at low
