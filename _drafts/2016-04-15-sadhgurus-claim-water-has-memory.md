I was surpised to see how much bullshit is in this a by Sadhguru. Worse of all, he claims that it is science. I posted this on Facebook and the comments below have been interesting, I'm sharing some of those interesting conversations here.

Summary of video: He claims that the structure of the water molecules can be changed through thoughts!

Sadhguru is a famous personality with a lot of followers. Some of them tried to defend what he said. Here are the comments and my responses to them.

Comment: May be its his perception of science.... You cannot reject his hypothesis.

Me: Science is based on evidence. Science can test a claim to be either true or not true. What do you mean by 'his' perception of science?

Comment: I don't want to further discuss on it.

Me:  Sure. Understandable. I just want to make another point that, in science, the person who comes up with the hypothesis has the burden of proof. Even if a hypothesis cannot be rejected, it shouldn't be given more credence. For example, the hypothesis that unicorns exist cannot be rejected.

Comment: If something's doesn't confirm to current scientific evidence doesn't mean it's "bullshit"

Me: He makes a claim that goes against everything we know about science. And falsely claims that it is science deluding millions of people. Do you think that's a reasonable thing to do? If you think there's a possibility that what he is saying is true, let me know if you willing to participate in an experiment to test the claim.

Comment: Here's a some [research](http://www.emotoproject.com/english/home.html) on water memory. He's not wrong.

Me: Emoto's research has a lot of flaws and is not accepted by the scientific community. His experiments are not double blind. Do you think it's okay to see this kind of research as evidence for justifying a claim that goes against almost everything we know about science?

Comment: Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8VyUsVOic0) on water memory.

Me: Luc's work on water memory has been very controversial and faced harsh criticism from many scientists. Apparently, his work was not reproducable. So, I think it's a bad idea to follow his work. On the internet you can find documentary about anything. Doesn't make it more true. For example, there are documentaries on how NASA faked moon landing, how UFOs are real and why the earth is flat.

Comment: I am not a big science guy like you all but I have a question. Does current science explain everything about water ? and there is nothing to learn further ? I don't think so. Today somebody theory might look funny, but in future the theory might be proved by the same science. Science is slow and it has lot of catch-up to do.

Me:  I agree there's a lot we don't know yet. Doesn't mean we have to accept any random hypothesis people come up with; there's no evidence for his claims. Worse of all, he lies to everyone saying these hypothesis are science. I'll make a claim that I can make water turn into ice by looking at it, would you agree with that? Would you still argue that I'm right, and science has a lot of catch-up to do? No, right? You would ask me for evidence. Why are you not doing the same for Sadhguru's claims?

Comment: I am sticking to the current topic in the video and I don't know what he said in other videos. If it is a theory today doesn't mean that it will not happen in future. He may be or wrong he may right. Whom and what to believe depends on oneself and what kind of knowledge the other person holds. If you start arguing for everything that everybody throws into the world, then there is nothing you gain. Listen, understand, grasp and move forward. You are not a follower of the Guru, so why worry. The followers may be fools or may not be.

Comment: Water has memory. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILSyt_Hhbjg)

Me: That's unreliable. Read [this](http://www.scilogs.com/in_scientio_veritas/water-memory-myth-that-wouldnt-die/).
