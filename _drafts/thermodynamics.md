This article is a part of a series where I will be talking about thermodynamics. Thermodynamics was not my favourite subject, specially because it did not seem as intuitive as any mechanics topic is. So, I decided to revisit and learn thermodynamics afresh trying to intuitively grasp all concepts.

### Why I'm taking this course

There's a strong reason why I'm taking up [thermodynamics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-thermodynamics). One of my friend made a claim that the molecular structure of water can be varied by sending music waves onto it. I somehow felt this was not possible, but I was not able to exactly explain why. So I decided that by taking this course, I'll gain insights to make my arguments more clearly when such topics come up.

### Quantized Energy Levels

It's very interesting how the atoms or molecules can have only take a discrete number of levels. That's so counter intuitive. 

The atoms can only have electronic energy (kinetic and potential energy associated with electrons) and translational energy (due to movement of atoms) where as molecule can additonally have rotational and vibrational energy.

For a typical molecule, the discrete states that the molecule can be in is well represented by the image below. It's also interesting to observe the difference in magnitudes for each of the energy levels.

### Energy of Photons

The energy on the photons depends on the frequency. This is another counter intuitive concept- that photons that are red have less energy than photos that are blue. 

The energy for a hydrogen chloride reaction to start is 242KJ/mol with is used to disassociate the chlorine atoms. This energy is almost equal to the energy of blue light; and less than the red light. This means that how much ever red photons you use, the reaction won't start; but with just little blue light the reaction can be started.
