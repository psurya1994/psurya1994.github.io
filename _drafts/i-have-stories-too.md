I have more experiences than most people with all the experiments I'm doing. I do have lots of stories to tell to people about my life too now. I was previously concerned I don't have enough because I don't go out a lot.

Ideas for productivity:
- Learning: I shouldn't make in a row commitments. They get irritating if you have other important commitments which come up.
- Reading papers is not very different from reading GRE essays. Have the same amount of focus!
- Idea to track progress while reading something. Take notes using a different pen every 8 minutes. 
- When you use your will power to do something, generally make sure it's a repetitive task and try to setup a system that makes it much more likely you'll do it tomorrow.
- Take a GRE verbal section test every Saturday to make sure your reading comprehension is upto the standards.
