Notes from reading about how to have better conversations

Key ideas: 
- Find humor in everything, laugh more often. Make other people feel funny. 
- (write a few stories to tell before hand): experience with prof at NITW, friend thesis story, my thesis story, what's my story, the kind of person I was.
- Focus on how you make other people feel. Listen more. Asking probing questions. Listen actively. Repeat their words. Exactly!
- Rising energy in the room. Come with higher energy level and higher silliness. 

Keeping conversation:
- This reminds me of _____.
- Ask open ended questions. (why ____?)
- How do you know each other? What's your story? What are you excited about in coming days? Do cold reading
- Push the burden onto them.
